# Development Plan

This document outlines the phased development approach for the AI Accounting Job Matching project. Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring a solid foundation and minimizing complications.

## Phase 1: Development Environment Setup

### 1.1 Virtual Environment & Dependencies
- [ ] Set up venv
- [ ] Install initial dependencies
- [ ] Configure pre-commit hooks for code quality
- [ ] Verify Python version matches `runtime.txt`

### 1.2 Local Development Configuration
- [ ] Create development `.env` file
- [ ] Set up logging configuration
- [ ] Configure pytest with fixtures
- [ ] Set up black/flake8/mypy configuration

## Phase 2: Database Foundation

### 2.1 Database Models & Migration Setup
- [ ] Create SQLAlchemy async base configuration
- [ ] Define read-only models for existing tables (AccountingFirm, Job)
- [ ] Define new models (User, UserSearch, etc.)
- [ ] Set up Alembic with a "non-destructive" approach
- [ ] Create initial migration that only adds new tables

### 2.2 Database Connection Layer
- [ ] Implement async session management
- [ ] Create database connection pool
- [ ] Add health check functionality
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Write thorough tests for database operations

## Phase 3: Core Services Layer

### 3.1 Embedding Service
- [ ] Set up OpenAI client configuration
- [ ] Implement embedding generation
- [ ] Create vector storage with pgvector
- [ ] Add caching layer for embeddings
- [ ] Write tests for embedding operations

### 3.2 Search Service
- [ ] Implement semantic search functionality
- [ ] Create job matching algorithms
- [ ] Add filtering and ranking
- [ ] Write tests for search accuracy

## Phase 4: API Layer

### 4.1 FastAPI Foundation
- [ ] Set up FastAPI application
- [ ] Implement authentication middleware
- [ ] Add health check endpoints
- [ ] Configure CORS and security
- [ ] Add API documentation

### 4.2 Core Endpoints
- [ ] Implement job search endpoints
- [ ] Add user management endpoints
- [ ] Create CV processing endpoints
- [ ] Write API tests

## Phase 5: Telegram Bot

### 5.1 Bot Framework
- [ ] Set up development bot
- [ ] Implement command handlers
- [ ] Add conversation state management
- [ ] Create user session handling

### 5.2 Bot Features
- [ ] Implement CV upload and processing
- [ ] Add job search functionality
- [ ] Create user preference management
- [ ] Add error handling and user feedback

## Phase 6: Background Tasks

### 6.1 Task Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up background task system
- [ ] Implement job embedding updates
- [ ] Add periodic maintenance tasks
- [ ] Create task monitoring

## Phase 7: Admin Dashboard

### 7.1 Monitoring Interface
- [ ] Set up Streamlit dashboard
- [ ] Add system metrics
- [ ] Implement log viewing
- [ ] Create user management interface

## Phase 8: Production Preparation

### 8.1 Production Configuration
- [ ] Set up production environment
- [ ] Configure production bot
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Implement backup procedures

### 8.2 Deployment
- [ ] Configure Fly.io deployment
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Implement zero-downtime updates
- [ ] Create rollback procedures

## Development Principles

### Test-Driven Development
- Write tests before implementing features
- Maintain high test coverage
- Include integration tests

### Database Safety
- Always preserve existing data
- Use non-destructive migrations
- Implement rollback capabilities

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error catching
- Detailed logging
- User-friendly error messages

### Documentation
- Keep PRD updated
- Document all APIs
- Maintain clear code documentation

## Progress Tracking
Each task has a checkbox that can be marked when completed. This helps track progress and ensures no steps are missed. The phases should be completed in order, as each builds upon the previous one.

## Notes
- This plan is a living document and may be updated as development progresses
- Each phase should be fully tested before moving to the next
- Regular commits should be made with clear, descriptive messages
- Documentation should be updated alongside code changes
